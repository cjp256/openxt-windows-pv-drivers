>>> If you aren't using vagrant, just run provision.ps1 and skip the below steps <<<

**********************
*  Why use vagrant?  *
**********************

1. Full automation of dev setup
   - Download a fresh Windows 10 base VM and provision it all with one command
   - Configure your VM settings in one place with a Vagrantfile
2. Consistency & predictability
   - After provisioning, all developers will be in the same exact initial state
   - Easy to reliably reproduce errors across builds
   - High chance your tested build will succeed on an official builder that is also using vagrant
3. Portability
   - Easy to share dev boxes without sending large amounts of data

**************************
*  Setting up your host  *
**************************

1.  Download vagrant directly from their site. The version on apt-get isn't as stable.
2.  Download the latest virtualbox. Again, do it directly from their site.
3a. Add the following lines to your ~/.ssh/config file to forward your ssh agent to your box:

    Host 127.0.0.1
        ForwardAgent yes

3b. Run ssh-add to make sure your ssh setup is up to date.

***************************
*  Setting up your guest  *
***************************

1. Edit the Guest VM Modifications portion of the Vagrantfile to your liking. These are basically just the VirtualBox settings.
   NOTE: there are many more configuration options available. See the vagrant docs for more: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/virtualbox/
2. Run 'vagrant up' in the top-level directory. This will download the base box, set up your environment, and download any dependencies you need for a build. The whole step will take between 30 minutes and an hour to complete.
3. Username and password to VM are both 'vagrant'

****************************
*  Basic vagrant commands  *
****************************

- vagrant up: start VM & provision if unprovisioned
- vagrant provision: force-rerun provisioning steps
- vagrant halt: stop VM
- vagrant reload: restart VM
- vagrant destroy: delete VM
- Other commands can be found in 'vagrant --help' menu
